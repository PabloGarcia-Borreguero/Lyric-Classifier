## Music Genre Classifier

This repository intends to build a classification
method for song lyrics into its respective music genres.
It does so by building latent vectors with Latent
Dirichlet Allocation and with feedforward neural networks
as classifiers.

The repository holds Poetry as a virtual environment manager.
Use "poetry install" to deploy the necessary dependencies.
